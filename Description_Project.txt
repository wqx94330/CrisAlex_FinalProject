Description: 


This Project was created to check the changes in the vegetation in the middle of Amazonia in the 
period of 9 years. The target place is Manaus one city present in the region of amazonia where
the deforestation and changes in the landuses are common. 



script: main.R (three more scripts with functions)

First we wanted to check the vegetation index, with two images of Landsat 5 (2001, 2010) we produced 
the NDVI and we calculated the difference to see the changes produced during 9 years.



Script:Manaus_population_diff_NDVI

After that, we took the data of population from 2000 and 2010, it is a shapefile with points
georeferended in Manaus city. With these data of person per Km in each point we calculate the 
difference of people during the 9 years to see in which parts increase or decrease the population.
Everything is visualized in a interactive maps with different size in the circles depend on the 
population size, a openstreetmap such as bacground and the difference of the NDVI of 9 years in 
the municipality of Manaus.
